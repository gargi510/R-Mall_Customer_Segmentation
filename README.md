# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation using R  

## 📌 Project Overview  

Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of business strategy, allowing companies to understand their customers better and optimize marketing efforts. This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, helping businesses tailor personalized experiences and improve customer retention.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  

- **Description**: The dataset consists of demographic and spending behavior data of mall customers.  
- **Features**:  
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer  
  - `Gender`: Customer's gender  
  - `Age`: Customer's age  
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Customer's yearly income in thousands of dollars  
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: A score assigned based on customer spending behavior

## 🎯 Objective  

✔ Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and insights.  
✔ Implement **K-Means Clustering** to categorize customers into distinct groups.  
✔ Visualize the customer segments to understand their characteristics.  
✔ Provide actionable insights for businesses to enhance marketing strategies.
